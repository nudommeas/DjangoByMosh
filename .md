# One to One Relationships (`OneToOneField`)
A one-to-one relationship is where one record in the first table corresponds to exactly one record in the second table.

# One to Many Relationship (`ForeignKey`)                   
One Side ( Parent ): A single instance (e,g One customer , one blog)
Many Side ( Child ): Can have many muliple related instances (e,g many orders, many posts)
--> Make sure each " Many " record is tied to a unique " One " record
For Example: One author can write many book, but each book has one author

# Many to Many Relationship (`ManyToManyField`)

# Generic Relationship (`GenericForeignKey`)
\\ from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
\\ from django.contrib.contenttypes.fields import GenericForeignKey
    content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    content_object = GenericForeignKey(content_type, object_id)

# How it works ( Simple Idea)
A generic relationship uses three fields:
1. content_type --> which model (Post, Photo)
2. object_id --> the ID of the object in that model
3. content_object --> the actual linked object (Post, Photo)

# python manage.py makemigrations 
# python manage.py migrate
# pip install mysqlclient
# mysql -u root -p

# MOCKAROO --> Website to generate dummy data

\\ Introduced to Django ORM \\

**What is Queryset?**
--> In simple definition:
## A QuerySet is the result you get when you ask Django for date using Model.

--> Important Points:
1. Lazy evaluation --> Django does not hit database until the data is needed
2. Chainable --> You can filter step by step `Post.object.filter(published=True).order_by('-created_at')`

**Common QuerySet Methods**
`.all() # get all records
.filter() # get matching records
.exclude() # exclude records
.get() # get exactly one object
.first() # frist object or None
.last()` # last object or None

**QuerySet Vs Object**
Post.objects.filter(id=1) # QuerySet
Post.object.get(id=1) # Single Object

**Field Lookups**
# __icontains 
# __contains --> lookup type
# __range --> lookup type
# __year 

**Complex Lookups using Q Objects**
from django.db.models import Q

OR ( | ) Operator
& ( AND ) Operator
~ ( NOT ) Operator

# order_by(*field) Method
# Limiting Queryset Result ( Slicing ) -> You can limit the number of results returned by slicing a QuerySet,Similiar to Python list Slicing. `[:]` offset
