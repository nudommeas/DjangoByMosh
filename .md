# One to One Relationships (`OneToOneField`)
A one-to-one relationship is where one record in the first table corresponds to exactly one record in the second table.

# One to Many Relationship (`ForeignKey`)                   
One Side ( Parent ): A single instance (e,g One customer , one blog)
Many Side ( Child ): Can have many muliple related instances (e,g many orders, many posts)
--> Make sure each " Many " record is tied to a unique " One " record
For Example: One author can write many book, but each book has one author

# Many to Many Relationship (`ManyToManyField`)

# Generic Relationship (`GenericForeignKey`)
\\ from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
\\ from django.contrib.contenttypes.fields import GenericForeignKey
    content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    content_object = GenericForeignKey(content_type, object_id)

# How it works ( Simple Idea)
A generic relationship uses three fields:
1. content_type --> which model (Post, Photo)
2. object_id --> the ID of the object in that model
3. content_object --> the actual linked object (Post, Photo)
