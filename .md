\\ Introduce to > Related-Object \\ 
# One to One Relationships (`OneToOneField`)
A one-to-one relationship is where one record in the first table corresponds to exactly one record in the second table.

# One to Many Relationship (`ForeignKey`)                   
One Side ( Parent ): A single instance (e,g One customer , one blog)
Many Side ( Child ): Can have many muliple related instances (e,g many orders, many posts)
--> Make sure each " Many " record is tied to a unique " One " record
For Example: One author can write many book, but each book has one author

# Many to Many Relationship (`ManyToManyField`)

# Generic Relationship (`GenericForeignKey`)
\\ from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
\\ from django.contrib.contenttypes.fields import GenericForeignKey
    content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    content_object = GenericForeignKey(content_type, object_id)

# How it works ( Simple Idea)
A generic relationship uses three fields:
1. content_type --> which model (Post, Photo)
2. object_id --> the ID of the object in that model
3. content_object --> the actual linked object (Post, Photo)

# python manage.py makemigrations 
# python manage.py migrate
# pip install mysqlclient
# mysql -u root -p

\\ Introduced to Django ORM \\

**What is Queryset?**
--> In simple definition:
## A QuerySet is the result you get when you ask Django for date using Model.

--> Important Points:
1. Lazy evaluation --> Django does not hit database until the data is needed
2. Chainable --> You can filter step by step `Post.object.filter(published=True).order_by('-created_at')`

**Common QuerySet Methods**
`.all() # get all records
.filter() # get matching records
.exclude() # exclude records
.get() # get exactly one object
.first() # frist object or None
.last()` # last object or None

**QuerySet Vs Object**
Post.objects.filter(id=1) # QuerySet
Post.object.get(id=1) # Single Object

**Field Lookups**

# __icontains 
# __contains --> lookup type
# __range --> lookup type
# __year 
# __gt, __lt
# `in` lookup 

**Complex Lookups using Q Objects**
from django.db.models import Q

OR ( | ) Operator
& ( AND ) Operator
~ ( NOT ) Operator

# `order_by(*field)`Method
# Limiting Queryset Result ( Slicing ) -> You can limit the number of results returned by slicing a QuerySet,Similiar to Python list Slicing. `[:]` offset

**Selecting Fields to query**
# `values()` method
# `distinct()` method

**Selecting Ralated Object**
# `select_related` method
# `prefetch_related` method

**Aggregating Objects**
`aggregate() `method

\\ ORM Operation: CRUD \\ 

**Creating Objects**
--> Create(Insert): To add a new record to the database, you create a new object in your application code and use the ORM's method to save or persist it. The ORM translates this into an INSERT SQL query
**Example: new_album = Album(title='Abbey', artist='The beatles')**
new_album.save()

# `create()` method --> second method

**Updating Objects**
--> Update(): To modify an existing record, you first retrieve the corresponding object, change its properties in the code, and then use the ORM's method to save the changes. This results in an UPDATE SQL Query
**Example: album = Album.objects.get(pk=3)** pk=pk
album.genre = 'Classic ROck'
album.save()

# `update()` method --> second method

**Deleting Objects**
--> Delete(): To remove a record, you retrieve the object and use the ORM's delete method. This translates to a DELETE SQL query
**Example: album = Album.objects.get(pk=3)**
album.delete() #delete the object from the database

**Reading Object**
Read(Select/Retrieve): To retrieve data, you use the ORM's querying API to find objects besed on specific criteria. The ORM generates SELECT SQL queries.

# Retrieving all objects:
The `all()` method returns a `QuerySet` containing all objects in the database for that model.

**Example: all_albums = Album.objects.all() or get(pk=1) Retreiving only a single object**

**The Admin Site**
--> python manage.py createsuperuser --> Create a user in the admin site
--> python manage.py changepassword admin 

__str__() method --> Provides a human-readable string representation of an object 

# class Meta:
1. It tells Django how the model shoudl behave, not what fields it has 
It is like sorting 
Common Meta options for models
| Option                | What it does                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `db_table`            | Custom table name in the database    |
| `ordering`            | Default order for queries            |
| `verbose_name`        | Human-readable singular name         |
| `verbose_name_plural` | Human-readable plural name           |
| `unique_together`     | Combination of fields must be unique |
| `indexes`             | Database indexes                     |
| `constraints`         | Database constraints                 |
